# Python-Block-Dodge-Game
A 2D game I programmed with python and the pygame modules.

The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible by dodging blocks and fighting enemies.

Avoid black blocks and collect blue circles to add to your trail

Your trail gives you extra lives, and each trail block is also ammo to beat enemies

Press "SPACE" to switch directions
Press "L_SHIFT" to shoot projectiles when fighting enemies


* Was going to refine code but moved on, thats why some parts aren't optimal :( *
