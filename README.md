# Python-Block-Dodge-Game
A 2D game I programmed with python and the pygame modules.

The goal of the game is to get the highest score possible by dodging blocks and fighing enemies.
Avoid black blocks and collect light blue trailblocks, these are your ammo and extra lives.
If you hit a black block and have a trail, you lose one trail block but live.
If you don't have any trailblocks left, then you die
You can shoot your trailblocks too, but you might need them to survive so use them wisely.

Press "SPACE" to switch directions
Press "L_SHIFT" to shoot projectiles


I used sound effects and music from the website https://www.epidemicsound.com/
